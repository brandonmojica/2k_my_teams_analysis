<h2>NBA 2k20 My Teams</h2>
This project is aimed at determining if cards from a certain universtity are faster than the rest of the cards (Players). This test I expored weather on average do players that come from Duke University are faster than than the rest of the players/cards. I chose this project because of interest in basketball and NBA 2k20. I spend a obscene amount of time playing this game, and I wanted to see if there was some basic stats I could try and leverage.I found the data of all the cards on the website: https://2kmtcentral.com/.

<h2>During my EDA</h2>
There are 1166 players/cards in my data set that each have 47 attributes. 


I found that my data was not clean. There were a few columns that had data that was meant to be in sperate columns but was combined into a single string.
